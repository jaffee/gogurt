* Overview

The basic idea here is for me to write a little bit of go code every
day, and then write about what I did. The rules are to do SOMETHING
every day that involves pushing some code to github. If I don't, my
wife gets ten bucks for her clothes shopping fund. If I do, then for
every 7 day streak, I get ten bucks for my 'buy whatever I want'
fund. The purpose is threefold:

1. Learn go.
2. Have consistent github activity.
3. Improve writing and blogging skills.

Hopefully soon, pushing code and posts will automatically update the
site, and I'll have some pretty way to display the code I wrote along
side the post.


** Day 1
Got basic structure set up - mostly looking here:
https://golang.org/doc/code.html

Basic HTTP server running - http://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/


* Future work ideas
- get code running on some hosting
- set up git hooks to restart it every time there's a push
- write a supervisor in go to restart it if it dies.
